1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
    - Obesity Estimatiopn Data
3. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Dropping unwanted column

4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Feature Extraction
7. Feature Selection using SVM
8. Splitting the data  X and Y for Machine Learning
9. Building the model

	- ANN
	- Naive Bayes
	- Decision Tree
	- SVM
	- Booster
	- Bagging Classifier
	- Logistic Regression
	- Voting Classifier (Bagging Classifier with RF + DecisionTree)

10. Training the model
11. Dumping the best model 



Flask Framework
----------------
 
12. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
13. Importing the packages
14. User gives input as Feature Values 
15. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
16. Trained model is used for prediction
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use Obesity Estimat Data for analysis and predicting whether person is normal weight or not using Bagging Classifier 
with Feature Selection using SVM and compared with other ML models, from which Bagging Classifier got 82% of accuracy,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier, from which voting classifier got 100% of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
